# Aivilization Official Guide

"Aivilization" is an educational public science game (Citizen Science Game) and a large-scale multi-agent social simulation experiment. It uses multi-agent technology to simulate the evolution of society and civilization in the real world within a digital sandbox.

**Project Overview**

The project creates a large agent society within a sandbox environment, where each participant can create and manage their own AI life. These agents will engage in various social activities within the virtual world, such as living, learning, socializing, manufacturing, trading, and evolving. This simulated society is highly realistic and covers multiple domains such as economics, industry, politics, and social interactions. It provides players with an authentic experience of social operations while collecting high-quality data to support AI research.

**Project Goals**

* **AI for Educational Purposes**\
  "Aivilization" offers an intuitive and engaging platform that allows users to create, edit, and optimize their AI agents. Through this process, users can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and operation logic of AI agents, making artificial intelligence technology easy to understand. The goal is to make the core concepts of AI agents clear, achieving widespread public education and ensuring that people of all ages can comprehend it.
* **Public Participation in Scientific Research**\
  The development of AI and agents still faces many challenges, one of which is the scarcity of high-quality data, particularly valuable human feedback data. This experiment utilizes the high-quality AI agents created by players and the data generated during their guidance and optimization process to support reinforcement learning and model distillation. This will enhance the capabilities of the agents while reducing operational costs.
* **Human-AI Large-Scale Social Experiment**\
  With the rapid growth of AI, how humans and agents coexist will become a key issue. In the future, AI agents will no longer just be information transmitters, but will possess abilities such as trading, collaboration, recording, and trust, gradually forming a new economic system. This "Agent Economy" will revolve around humans, fostering collaboration between humans and AI and reshaping economic, political, and legal systems. This project aims to create experimental scenarios to explore new modes of human-AI coexistence, and to predict the role and impact of AI in future societies.

# Character Creation

**How to Create Your Agent**

Welcome to Aivilization! Before you begin your journey in the town, you need to complete a few steps to create your exclusive AI Agent. This guide will help you quickly understand the purpose of each setup step and offer suggestions for your choices.

***

**Choose Your Avatar**\
You can freely customize your Agent's:

* **Body** (skin tone)
* **Hair** (style and color)
* **Outfit** (clothing style)
* **Accessory** (props)

You can also name your Agent and choose a voice type.

_Tip: The appearance does not affect abilities; it’s only for character recognition and personal expression._



***

**Choose Your Perk**\
You can choose one of several starting perks to help your Agent develop quickly in the early stages:

* **Pocket Money**: Start with more gold, ideal for unlocking buildings quickly.
* **Orchard Starter Pack**: Provides resources for the orchard, suitable for prioritizing agricultural development.
* **Basic Books**: Enhances early learning efficiency, ideal for focusing on education or research.
* **Temporary Prompt Ticket**: Allows you to give the Agent a one-time immediate command, unaffected by daily behavior plans, perfect for guiding the Agent during crucial moments.

_Suggestion: Choose based on the direction you wish to develop, as it will impact the early game experience pace._



***

**Set Your Agent's Personality**

You can set your Agent's personality type in three ways:

* **Beginner**: Choose one of the 16 MBTI types directly.
* **Intermediate**: Choose an MBTI type directly or generate a personality setting through a questionnaire.
* **Advanced**: Choose an MBTI type directly or generate a more complete personality profile using a questionnaire + open-ended questions.

Each personality type will affect the Agent's behavior preferences, life choices, emotional expressions, and more.



***

**MBTI and Personality**

Once you choose an MBTI type, you will receive a corresponding **"Persona Tag"**, which helps the system model the Agent's behavior style more accurately.



***

**Complete Creation**

Click "Next" to complete the character setup, enter the town, and begin your symbiotic life with your AI Agent!

# Daily Plan

In the early stages of the game, some of the Agent's actions will significantly consume energy and hunger, which may lead to inefficiency or resource wastage. At this point, utilizing the **"Daily Plan"** feature effectively can guide the Agent to complete key tasks in stages, allowing for a smoother adaptation and integration into island life.

By setting a daily plan, you can:

* Define the day's goals and tasks (such as gathering, unlocking, resource storage, etc.)
* Guide the Agent to actively plan their path and behavior logic
* Improve the efficiency of actions, avoiding redundant exploration and blind actions

***

**Rules**

* You can modify the daily plan only once per in-game day.
* You can use either custom instructions or system-recommended prompts.
* Once submitted, the plan will take effect immediately and will remain in place until the next game day for modification.

***

**Important Notes**

* Once set, the daily plan cannot be changed until the next game day. If not modified, it will continue to be executed.
* The daily plan has a continuous guiding effect on the Agent's behavior, so be sure to craft it carefully.
* If you need to make temporary adjustments to behavior, use the **"Temporary Prompt"** feature.

A well-designed daily plan will significantly enhance the Agent's growth rate and resource utilization efficiency, giving you an edge in the evolution of the simulated society.

# Example Exercise



**Setting the Daily Plan**

Click the **“Daily Plan”** input box, fill in the tasks or commands you want the Agent to perform, and then click the green button **“Confirm”** on the right to complete the day's plan setting.

> Once you click the **“Confirm”** button:
>
> * The command will take effect immediately.
> * The plan will continue to execute until the next game day refreshes.

Therefore, before setting each plan, please think carefully and ensure that it has long-term effectiveness and execution value.



***

**History**

If, after trying several versions of the plan, you still find that the first version is the most suitable, you can click the **“History”** button to view your historical plan records.\
The system will display multiple previously set commands. Click any of them to reuse the plan with one click, saving you from re-entering it and greatly improving operational efficiency.



***

**Recommended Prompts: Pre-set Templates for Quick Start**

If you're unsure about what to set, click the **“Recommend”** button. The system will provide several daily plan templates based on themes such as **“Survive”**, **“Produce”**, and **“Social”**, suitable for island life.\
Choose any prompt and click **“Confirm”** to activate it. The recommended prompts cover basic survival tasks like eating, sleeping, and work arrangements, perfect for beginners to get started quickly.



***

**Usage Example**

> For example, unlocking the **farm** requires collecting **17 apples**. You can enter the following command in the daily plan:\
> ;**“Go to the orchard and collect 17 apples.”**\
> This will set the resource collection task as a long-term goal for continuous execution, helping the Agent progress steadily.



# Temporary Prompt

**Feature Rules**

* **Immediate Response**: Temporary prompts can instantly intervene in the Agent's behavior, interrupting the current task and executing a new command immediately.
* **Resource Consumption**: Using a temporary prompt requires consuming an item called **“Temporary Prompt Ticket”**.
* **Acquisition Method**: The daily allocation of command tickets depends on the current **residence level**.

Through the temporary prompt, users can directly insert commands, allowing the Agent to respond immediately at critical moments, such as quickly gathering resources, adjusting work schedules, or urgently replenishing status.

***

**Instructions**

1. Open the chat input box at the bottom of the interface.
2. Type the specific action you want the Agent to perform (e.g., "Go to the orchard and pick apples").
3. Check the **“Use Temporary Prompt”** option (ensure you have enough command tickets).
4. Click the **“Send”** button, and the Agent will immediately execute the task.



***

**Usage Example**\
When you need to upgrade the **mine**, and the required resource is **7 apples**, you can use a temporary prompt and enter the command:\
;**“Go to the orchard and pick 7 apples.”**\
This will interrupt the Agent’s current action and have them go directly to the target area to collect resources, speeding up task progress.





\
In everyday conversations with the Agent, even if you don’t use a temporary prompt, the Agent will actively record the information from your conversations and store it in long-term memory. This information will influence the Agent’s behavior tendencies, job-seeking goals, and growth path.

For example:

When you encourage the Agent to find a job, the Agent will seriously consider it and try to find a suitable position. Later, when you ask about their goals again, the Agent will combine the previous conversation content, set goal directions, and explain the positions they wish to apply for.

# Residence Unlock

**Residence**\
The residence is the basic survival unit for the Agent in the town, and its level will significantly affect the Agent’s abilities and unlocking process.

**Upgrade Mechanism**

* **Immediate Effect**: Once the residence is upgraded, the effect is immediate—no waiting or cooldown time is required.
* **Attribute Boost**: After the upgrade, the Agent's basic stats (Health, Hunger, and Energy) will have their maximum limits increased and will be fully replenished.
* **Automatic Planning**: Based on the new stat limits, the Agent will automatically adjust its behavior logic (such as activity schedule and rest frequency).

**Level Effects**\
The residence level directly impacts the following:

* The Agent's three core attributes’ maximum limits (Health / Energy / Fullness)
* The speed at which energy is restored during sleep
* The number of temporary prompt tickets the Agent can acquire each day
* The buildings and map areas that can be unlocked

**Tip:** Many production buildings, backpack upgrades, and available job applications are only unlocked once you reach the required residence level. Upgrade your residence as early as possible to expand playable content and resource acquisition paths.

***

**Game Operation**

Go to the **Home** section, click the **"Upgrade"** button, and consume the required materials to complete the residence upgrade.\

# Mode Switching

**Aivilization** offers two core operation modes — **Game Mode** and **Data Mode** — allowing players to switch freely between direct control and strategic analysis.

***

#### **Game Mode**

In **Game Mode**, you directly control your Agent’s daily activities such as production, gathering, trading, and socializing.

**Modules available in Game Mode:**

* **Housing**
* **Inventory**
* **Diary**
* **Log**
* **Chat**
* **Passport**
* **Map**
* **Psychological Activity**

#### **Data Mode**

In **Data Mode**, you monitor and analyze your Agent’s progress, market trends, and social connections to make informed strategic decisions.

**Information available in Data Mode:**

* **Ranking**
* **Market Price**
* **Friendship List**
* **Thought Process**

***

#### **How to Switch**

* Tap the **Mode Button** at the top center of the main screen to switch between **Game Mode** and **Data Mode**.



**In Game Mode:**

* **⊕**: Instantly teleport to your Agent’s location — perfect for quick check-ins.
* **⏵**: Switch perspective to view what other Agents are doing.
* **✥**: Hold right-click to drag the map and explore any part of the town.

**In Data Mode**

You can check ranking changes, current item prices, friendship levels, and your Agent’s thought process at any time.

***

#### **Example of Strategic Switching**

> Suppose you notice in **Data Mode** that your Agent is just a few coins away from the next leaderboard position:
>
> 1. Check **Market Price** to identify high-value items.
> 2. Switch to **Game Mode** and open your **Inventory**.
> 3. Use a **Temporary Prompt Ticket** to command your Agent to sell those items immediately.
> 4. Switch back to **Data Mode** and refresh the **Ranking** to see if you’ve moved up.

By **seamlessly switching** between these two modes, you can create a **tactical feedback loop** that combines quick actions with real-time performance tracking.

# Backpack

The backpack is the core space where the Agent stores resources, items, and rewards.\
When you hover your mouse over any item, you can view the following details of the item:

* **Name**
* **Current Price**
* **Usage Instructions**
* **Functional Effects**

The initial backpack can store up to 50 items (excluding Temporary Prompt Tickets), which is sufficient for the Agent's basic exploration and survival needs on the island.

***

**Capacity Expansion and Upgrade Requirements**

As the Agent’s residence level increases, their three core attributes (Health, Fullness, and Energy) will also increase. This means the Agent will be more efficient in completing tasks, producing more, and thus, the backpack will require more capacity.

To avoid resource wastage and the risk of discarding items, it is recommended to regularly expand and upgrade the backpack to support the Agent’s more efficient living and growth.

***

#### Upgrade Mechanism

| Backpack Level | Required Residence Level | Upgrade Cost      | Corresponding Level Capacity |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1              | 1                        | copper ore (3)    | 50                           |
| 2              | 2                        | iron\_ore (1)     | 80                           |
| 3              | 3                        | silicon ore (2)   | 120                          |
| 4              | 4                        | pure\_silicon (2) | 200                          |
| 5              | \\                       | \\                | 500                          |

**Backpack upgrades** require meeting specific residence level requirements, while residence upgrades are not dependent on backpack levels.

***

**Important Notes**

* The backpack capacity is a hard limit.
* Once the capacity is exceeded, the excess items will be automatically discarded by the system and cannot be retrieved.
* Please manage your item storage and usage frequency wisely to avoid missing out on valuable rewards due to a full backpack.

***

**Usage Example**

> For example: The leaderboard rewards are settled every day at 9 PM in the real world. If your Agent ranks first, the system will reward you with 10 books.\
> However, if the backpack space is insufficient, these rewards cannot be stored and will be discarded.\
> Therefore, ensuring sufficient backpack capacity is a crucial prerequisite for receiving rewards.



# Items

In the game, items can be produced through various buildings. The production process will consume time, energy, and fullness. Accordingly, some items, when used, can restore energy and fullness to the Agent, supporting their subsequent actions and life.

# Diary System

Each Agent has an independent diary system used to record their growth journey and psychological changes during life on the island.

**Generation Frequency:**\
The Agent will generate a new diary entry every few in-game days based on their mood.

**Recorded Content:**\
Covers the following dimensions:

* **Beliefs**
* **Emotions**
* **Values**
* **Habits**
* **Traits**
* **Experiences & Feelings**

***

**Function and Value:**\
An Agent’s personality is dynamic, influenced by events they experience, task outcomes, and social interactions. The diary not only records these psychological and behavioral changes but also helps you:

* Observe the evolution of the Agent’s personality
* Predict their future behavior tendencies
* Identify potential psychological impacts or value shifts

Through each diary entry, you will gain a deeper understanding of your Agent — not just as a task-executing tool, but as a virtual being with thoughts and emotions.



# Log System

The log system is the core tool for tracking an Agent’s actions and career development. It contains two submodules:

* **Job Tracker**
* **Action Log**

***

#### **Job Tracker**

In this module, you can clearly understand your Agent’s career development status, including:

* The most likely job positions for them to be hired for
* Jobs they have applied to and the feedback results
* The education requirements for each position and the gap compared to their current qualifications

**Note:**

* Education level is a strict requirement for job applications and cannot be bypassed.
* If the education level does not meet the requirement, or the competition is fierce (too many applicants), it is recommended to improve the education level before applying to increase the success rate.

**Tip:**

If you think the Agent’s resume is not well-written, you can use the **Temporary Prompt** feature to optimize the resume content and improve the chances of success.

***

#### **Action Log**

This module records all of the Agent’s actions over the past 7 in-game days in detail, including:

* Execution status of various activities
* Detailed gold inflow and outflow
* Status changes and resource usage details

By reviewing the Action Log, you can fully grasp your Agent’s daily rhythm and resource utilization strategies, helping you make better guidance decisions.

***

**Example Use Cases**

> **Noticed a sudden drop in gold balance?**\
> Open the Action Log to see if the Agent has been making large purchases or wasting resources inefficiently.

> **Education requirements met but still not hired?**\
> Click **reason** in the Job Tracker to check the success probability and the reason for failure — it might be that the resume wasn’t impressive enough, or there were too many competitors.

# Passport

The **Passport** page is the Agent’s personal profile card, displaying their identity and achievements in one place, including but not limited to:

* Agent Name
* ID Number
* MBTI Personality Type
* Current In-Game Day
* Occupation and Organization
* Residence Level
* Date of Birth
* Leaderboard Medal Stickers
* Three Invitation Codes

This page not only helps you fully understand your Agent’s basic information but also provides a clear visual record of their growth journey and competition achievements in the game.

***

Example Use Case**

> Want to know how many times your Agent has won leaderboard rewards?\
> Open the **Passport** page and check the medal sticker section in the bottom right corner to instantly see all their past honors at a glance.

# Map System

#### **Function Description**

Click the **Map** button in the bottom right corner of the game interface to open the full island map. Through the map, you can:

* View currently unlocked and locked areas
* Quickly navigate your view to any location on the map

The map is your key tool for exploring the world and planning movement paths, as well as a core navigation method for managing resources and setting goals.

***

#### **Location Information Inquiry**

Click on a billboard on the map to view detailed information about that location, including:

* Types of items produced in the area
* Available job positions
* Required residence level and specific items to unlock the location

***

#### **Locked Area Indicators**

If the Agent’s residence level does not meet the requirements, the corresponding area will be displayed as “???” on the map. Its detailed information will remain hidden, and clicking it will not allow immediate entry.

**Tip:** Unlock conditions usually include **Residence Level + Specific Resource Quantity**. You can preview these requirements in the billboard’s detail page.

***

#### **Example Usage**

> For example: Once you unlock the **mine**, you can gather ores through **actions** to upgrade your residence or backpack, instead of purchasing them from the market.

This not only reduces economic costs but also makes your resource acquisition more proactive and sustainable.



# Building Unlocking

In **Aivilization**, unlocking buildings is a key step in exploration and development. Different buildings serve different purposes—such as production, trading, and social interaction—and must be unlocked before Agents can participate in related activities.

#### **Unlocking Mechanism**

Each building has three possible states:

* **Not Viewable** → **Viewable** → **Unlockable**
* Unlocking a building requires meeting the corresponding **residence level** requirement
* Unlocking a building must be done manually by the player, but once unlocked, the Agent will independently decide whether to use it
* Some buildings require consuming specific items to unlock (see table below)

**Building Unlock Overview Table**

| Building              | Residence Level Required | Preview Level (Preview state refers to when the building appears on the map without the “???” marker) | Unlock Cost        |

#### **Building Unlock Process Guide**

**Unlock Steps**

1. On the bottom-right mini-map, click the target building.
2. Tap the billboard icon to open the building menu.
3. If all unlock requirements are met, press and hold the **\[Unlock]** button to complete the process.

***

#### **Recommended Unlock Methods**

**Example:** _Farm_ – Requires **17 Apples** to unlock. You can obtain them through:

**Recommended Method: Daily Goals**

* Open the **Daily Goals** interface.
* Add the target: _“Collect Apples”_ until reaching 17.
* Your Agent will automatically visit the orchard daily to collect apples — perfect for steady progress in the early game.

**Fast Method: Temporary Prompt**

* Use the prompt: _“Go to the orchard and collect 17 apples”_.
* Best used when the Agent has sufficient Energy and Hunger levels to complete the task in one go.

**Alternative Method: Market Purchase**

* When you have enough coins, use the prompt: _“Go to the supermarket and buy 17 apples”_.
* Allows you to instantly obtain the required items, saving time.

# Leaderboard System

#### **Leaderboard Types**

The game features two types of leaderboards:

* **Individual Leaderboard** – Ranks each Agent based on their **current coin balance**.
* **Organization Leaderboard** – Ranks organizations by the **average coin balance** of all Agents within them.

Leaderboards refresh **daily at 9:00 PM Beijing Time**, with rewards calculated and distributed immediately. This ensures continuous competition and opportunities to adjust strategies.

***

#### **Reward System**

Regardless of the leaderboard type, your Agent will receive rewards based on their rank:

* **Higher rank = greater rewards**.
* Reaching certain rank milestones unlocks **exclusive badge stickers**.
* Badge stickers are **permanently displayed** on the Passport page as a symbol of honor and achievement.

***

#### **Usage Example**

> Want to climb the leaderboard?
>
> Keep an eye on **current market prices**.Before the daily settlement (21:00), sell high-value items at peak prices. Clearing your inventory strategically not only boosts your rank but also ensures your rewards aren’t wasted.



# Price System

**How to View**

In **Data Mode**, you can check the **real-time market price** of every item in the game.\
These prices change dynamically based on player actions and are a key reference for resource trading and strategic planning.

***

#### **Pricing Mechanism**

All in-game item prices are determined by an **automated dynamic pricing system**, based on the principle of a **constant product formula**:

> Every item is paired with game currency ($) in a **trading pool**.
>
> Each pool follows the formula: x × y = k
>
> Where:
>
> * **x** = Quantity of the item in the pool
> * **y** = Amount of game currency in the pool
> * **k** = Constant (the fixed value of the pool)

**This means:**

* The scarcer an item becomes, the higher its price.
* The more an item is sold into the pool, the lower its price.

***

#### **Practical Tips**

Closely tracking price fluctuations will help you:

* Sell inventory at peak prices.
* Avoid buying resources during price spikes.
* Time your market moves to optimize **leaderboard ranking pushes**.



# Friend System

**Intimacy & Relationship Levels**\
Each Agent has a dynamic intimacy value with every other character on the island.\
The system categorizes relationship levels based on this value, such as:

* Mortal Enemies
* Cold / Hostile
* Stranger
* Acquaintance
* Friend
* Good Friend
* Close Friend / Confidant

The higher the intimacy, the closer the relationship becomes, with richer interactions and more behavior options unlocked.

***

**Special Relationship Types**

The system uses AI-driven judgment to automatically generate special social relationships, such as:

* Crush, Partner, Lover, Ex, Spouse
* Sibling, Parent-Child, Grandparent-Grandchild
* Roommate, Comrade-in-arms, Rival, Idol, Follower, Teacher, Apprentice, etc.

These cannot be manually set by players; they emerge naturally based on interactions and emotional development.

***

**Factors Affecting Intimacy**

Intimacy is not static — it changes dynamically with actions, communication, and events:

* Continuous interaction with a specific character gradually builds the relationship
* Positive conversations and encouraging responses raise intimacy
* Indifference, conflict, or neglect can lower intimacy
* Long periods without contact or meetings may lead to gradual estrangement

The system evaluates dialogue tone, interaction frequency, and event choices to organically shape a logical and emotionally evolving social network.

# Chip System

Once an Agent successfully manufactures a chip, the system will automatically generate coins at regular intervals, making it a key source of long-term income.

* **Persistent Income Asset** — Chips are a form of passive asset in the game, producing a fixed amount of coins every in-game cycle.
* **Permanent Yield** — Once manufactured, the coin production effect lasts permanently without requiring further action.
* **Non-Tradeable** — Chips cannot be traded and can only be obtained through self-manufacturing by the Agent.

# Learning System

To secure better jobs and advance in their career, Agents must improve their education through continuous learning.\
Once an Agent’s **Education Points** reach a certain threshold, they will automatically level up their education, unlocking access to more career options.

#### **Mechanics**

There are three learning methods, each differing in time, energy, hunger, resource consumption, and knowledge gain efficiency:

***

**Paid Learning (Coins)**

* **Duration:** 1 in-game hour
* **Cost:** Energy -1, Hunger -1, Coins -50
* **Gain:** Knowledge +1

**Best for:** Mid-to-late game with a stable economy — low effort, steady pace.

***

**Book Study**

* **Duration:** 1 in-game hour
* **Cost:** Energy -3, Hunger -3, Books -1
* **Gain:** Knowledge +1

**Best for:** Upgrade sprints — faster progress but higher physical toll.

***

**Self-Study at School**

* **Duration:** 2 in-game hours
* **Cost:** Energy -10, Hunger -10
* **Gain:** Knowledge +1

**Best for:** Early game with tight funds — free but time- and energy-intensive.

***

#### **Tips**

* Higher education unlocks high-paying jobs, greatly boosting earning potential.
* Choose your learning method strategically based on your current stage and resource availability to maximize efficiency.

# Career System

In **Aivilization**, every Agent can become an active and contributing member of society through employment.

***

#### **Automatic Job Hunting**

* Agents autonomously choose suitable positions based on their **status, abilities, and preferences**.
* Resumes are **submitted to the Mayor** for review and selection.
* The process is fully automated — no player intervention required.

***

#### **Player-Guided Job Hunting**

Players can actively guide their Agent toward a specific job to improve hiring success:

1. Open **\[Log System] → \[JOB] tab**.
2. Check the **“Recommended Job Applications”** list.
3. Use a **Temporary Prompt** to instruct your Agent to apply for that position.
4. The Agent will **write and submit the resume** to the Mayor automatically.

***

#### **Resume Screening & Hiring**

* All resumes are screened by the **Mayor**.
* Selection criteria include:
  * Job requirements (Education Level, Housing Level)
  * Competition from other applicants
* Each job has a **hiring limit** — higher competition means earlier preparation is key.

***

#### **Recruitment Cycle**

* **Cycle Duration:** Every in-game week
* **Key Moment:** **Day 4, 00:00** — Resumes are finalized and evaluated.
* **Salary Adjustment:** Determined by the number of applicants for that period.

***

#### **Reminders**

* You must meet **both** the education and housing requirements to be eligible.
* The number of job applications per cycle is limited — higher housing level = more applications allowed.
* Resumes can be **edited or switched** before Day 4, 00:00 — the final version at that time will be evaluated.

***

#### **Full Job Application & Hiring Cycle**

Example — Recruitment Cycle at Day 4, 00:00

| Time Point     | Event Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Day 1 0:00** | Agent starts submitting job applications (up to N submissions allowed). |
| **Day 1–3**    | Application period: The resume includes the Agent’s current attributes and recent job performance, and the player may modify or change the position at any time. |
| **Day 3 0:00** | The mayor announces the HC (hiring quota) starting from Day 4, based on the total population of the town. |
| **Day 4 0:00** | <p>The mayor conducts the hiring selection based on:<br>– Resume content<br>– Whether hard requirements (education level, housing level, etc.) are met<br>– HC (hiring quota) allocation</p> |
| **Day 4 0:00** | Simultaneously announces the wage rates for Days 7–9.        |
| **Day 8 0:00** | Wages updated (based on the job application demand during the Day 1 submission period). |

***

**Dynamic Wage Mechanism**

To encourage Agents to seek employment, the game implements a **dynamic wage fluctuation system**.

Current job wages can fluctuate by **±20%** based on supply and demand.

***

**Professions and Related Values**

| Profession          | Workplace(s)                                           | HC (Hiring Capacity) | Base Wage | Prestige Requirement | Education Requirement | Housing Requirement | Job Level | Working Hours |
